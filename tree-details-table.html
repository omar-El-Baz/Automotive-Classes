    <article>
        <h4>Pine, maple, oak, and fir are all types of trees, each belonging to different botanical families and known
            for their unique characteristics. Pine trees are conifers, meaning they are evergreen trees with needle-like
            leaves, and they produce cones as part of their reproductive cycle. Maple trees, in contrast, are deciduous
            trees with broad leaves that often change color in the fall, and they are well-known for producing sap that
            can be made into maple syrup. Oak trees are also deciduous, with lobed leaves and strong wood commonly used
            in furniture and construction; they produce acorns, which are a food source for various wildlife. Fir trees,
            like pines, are also conifers, featuring needles and cones, and are often used as Christmas trees due to
            their dense, symmetrical shape. Together, these trees represent a range of ecosystems and play significant
            ecological and economic roles.</h4>
